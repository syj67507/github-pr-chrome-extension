# Privacy Policy

This privacy document describes the data that is requested by the GitHub PR Chrome Extension in order for this extension to function successfully. By downloading and installing this browser extension, you acknowledge the practices that are described in this privacy policy.

The data collected in this extension is only used for allowing the extension to function. Your privacy is respected and every effort is made to make sure that expectations for privacy are met. This document will present all information that is requested from you, how it is collected, and how it is used. It is encouraged that this document is read carefully before using the browser extension.

If you disagree with the data being requested, how it is collected, or how it used, please stop using the extension immediately and uninstall it from your browser.

## Information Requested

This extension requests only one piece of relatively sensitive information, a GitHub personal access token. This token is expected to have the "repo" scope, providing full control of private repositories. Please note that while the API key will have full control of private repositories, the extension will in no way ever manipulate any repositories, public or private.

## Information Collected

This extension collects the personal access token through a text field under the Permissions page of the extension. Upon saving the access token, it will be stored within the browser synchronized storaged, which will be synced across all browser instances that you are logged into across different devices. This personal access token is not stored in any other location. Data for any configured repositories will be collected for display by the extension. Data will not be fetched for any repository that has not been configured by you first.

## Information Use

This extension requires the personal access token in order to function successfully. This token is simply an API key that is used for authenticating requests to GitHub's REST API. All requests are read only requests and do not call any endpoints that have the ability to manipulate repository information in any way.

## Security

Information that is collected is not stored in any location other than the synced storage provided by the browser's extension API's. This synced storage is limited to the browsers that you have logged into. In addition to not being stored other than on the browser, this information cannot and will not be sold.

## Changes to this Privacy Policy

The right to revise this privacy policy from time to time is reserved. Continued use of this extension indicates your acknowledgement and consent of the updated Privacy Policy.
